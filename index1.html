        <p class="para">What JDM listicle would be complete without giving props to the cars that have given ourâ€”and
            consequently yourâ€”eyes a proverbial boner over the years? Our rounds up the most popular builds we've
            featured from Japan over the years, ranging from Civics and Skylines to S-chassis, RX-7s, AE86s, and others.
            We know there are tons of modified rides that are completely worthy to fill a top 100, but we had to limit
            this list to what we could pull out of our collective Super Street archives, and builds that are actually
            from Japan, ordered from most visited on down. So without further ado, we humbly submit to you the top
            builds of the heap.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="para">Thereâ€™s no doubt that car enthusiasts consider the 1990s to be the golden era for Japanese
            Domestic Market (JDM) cars.Electric cars were still a distant vision at the tail end of the last decade and the performance vehicles rolling off the production line in Japanâ€™s powerhouse motor industry were still entirely mechanical.</p>
